Rules
=====

Horizon uses rules for specifying constraints for DRC as well as input
for various tools such as the interactive router. Rules are evaluated
top to bottom and the first rule matching all criteria will be applied.
So it’s up to you to make sure that rules are ordered from more specific
to less specific. It’s always a good idea to have a catchall rule at the
very bottom.
