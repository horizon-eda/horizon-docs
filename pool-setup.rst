Setting up a pool
=================

There are two ways of setting up a pool. If you are familiar with the version control system git and want to be in direct control of your repository you can use the git workflow below, if not, just use the pool manager.

Git

If you're familiar with git, just clone clone
`horizon-pool <https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/>`_
somewhere and you're good to go. You're supposed to use git to keep your
local copy up to date and submit new parts.

Pool manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't know how to git? No problem! Double-click ``horizon-eda.exe`` or
launch ``./horizon-eda`` from your shell and click on 'Download...' to
download the pool. The default pool ``horizon-eda/horizon-pool`` is
the one you want to use. The pool manager will assist you in keeping
your pool up-to-date, see the "Remote" tab. It will also assist you by
creating a fork, branches, commits and pull requests on your behalf so
you can contribute to the pool without any git knowledge.
