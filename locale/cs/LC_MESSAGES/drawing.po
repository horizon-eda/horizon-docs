"Lines are usually used for everything visual (e.g. Silkscreens) while "
"polygones are used for all things where it matters that the thing you "
"draw results in a closed shape (pads, board outlines, package assembly "
"and courtyard layers, etc.)"

msgid "Draw Line"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:22
msgid ""
"To draw a line simply select the \"Draw line\" Action in the spacebar "
"menu or type the key sequence :kbd:`d l` (think: \"draw line\") â€“ once "
"you click anywhere, you start the first point of the line right at the "
"place where your manipulator was. You might notice that the point snaps "
"to the grid. If you want a finer grid hold the :kbd:`Alt` key down while "
"placing points. Left mouse button places more and more points, while the "
"right mouse button (or pressing :kbd:`Esc`) will finish the lines."

"You might also have noticed the Action Bar at the left bottom of the "
"editor window:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:28
msgid ""
"The Action bar will show additional keys you can press to change the "
"behaviour of the tool. In this case you could press :kbd:`w` to change "
"the width of the stroke or :kbd:`/` to restrict the movment of the "
"manipulator to one direction."

msgid "Draw Line Rectangle"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:36
msgid ""
"To save your time, there is also a \"Draw line rectangle\" Action, which "
"can also be invoked by typing :kbd:`d L`. Per default you first set the "
"rectangles center point and than one of the corner points. By pressing :"
"kbd:`c` you can change this behaviour and set two diagonally opposed "
"corner points instead."

msgid "Draw Arc"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:44
msgid ""
"The \"Draw arc\" tool is straightforward it draws line arcs by setting "
"three points (in this order): start point, end point and the center "
"point. You can also use the key sequence :kbd:`d a` to start the tool. If "
"you want your arc to flip direction, press :kbd:`e` before putting down "
"the center point."

msgid "Draw Polygon"

#: ../../drawing.rst:51
msgid ""
"When drawing polygons with :kbd:`d y` you can set a series of points by "
"clicking, until you either press :kbd:`Esc` or use the right mouse "
"button. You can make the next edge of the polygon an arc by pressing :kbd:"
"`a`. Just like with the \"Draw Arc\" tool set the endpoint first and the "
"center point after. Before setting the center point you can flip the arc "
"direction with :kbd:`e` and finally you set the end point of the arc."

msgid "Draw Polygon Rectangle"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:61
msgid ""
"Similar to the \"Draw line rectangle\" Tool there is a \"Draw polygon "
"rectangle\" tool. Invoke it by typing :kbd:`d Y`. Just like with the "
"according line Tool you can switch between the different draw modes "
"(Center/Corner) by pressing :kbd:`c`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:63
msgid ""
"There are some differences though: you can set a corner radius by "
"pressing :kbd:`r` and entering a value and you can choose a decoration by "
"pressing :kbd:`d`. These decorations are used to mark the pin 1 on a "
"Package's assembly layer. You can cycle through different decoration "
"positions by pressing :kbd:`p` and set the size of the decoration by "
"pressing :kbd:`s` and entering a value."

msgid "Draw Polygon Circle"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:72
msgid ""
"For ease of use there is also a \"Draw polygon circle\" Tool. With the "
"first click you set the circles center point and by setting the second "
"point you set the radius. You can also enter a radius by pressing :kbd:"
"`r` and entering a value."

msgid "Draw Dimension"
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:82
msgid ""
"Sometimes it can be useful to add dimension information to certain parts. "
"You can do so by using the \"Draw dimension\" ActToolion. Start it by "
"typing :kbd:`d d`, selecting the first and the second point and dragging "
"it out. If the numeric value is on the wrong side, you can fix it by "
"selecting the dimension and flipping it with the :kbd:`e` key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../drawing.rst:84
msgid ""
"Dimensions can also be set to specified length by selecting the end "
"that's supposed to move and activating the \"Enter Datum\" tool (press "
"Enter). You can then snap other items to the end points of the dimension."
