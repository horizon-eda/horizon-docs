"Writing a good autorouter is a lot of work that's more well spent on "
"other aspects of the application as experience has show that an "
"autorouter is rarely useful for small to medium-sized boards."

msgid ""
"Schematic design for PCBs and schematic design for SPICE-type simulation "
"are very different as in that schematics for simulation will often "
"simplify aspects of the real world such as replacing an ADC input with "
"it's equivalent circuit. On a personal side I'm perfectly happy with "
"LTSpice in terms of user interface and SPICE core and don't see much "
"scope for new developments in that space."

msgid ""
"Other EDA applications recently gained a custom raytracer for rendering "
"pretty 3D visualisations of circuit boards. For horizon that's out of "
"scope as the OpenGL-based 3D view is pretty enough for checking for the "
"board for issues such as forgotten solder mask and getting an idea of "
"what it'll look like assembled. Any more pretty visualisation is best "
"taken care of by exporting to 3D modelling software such as blender."

msgstr ""

#: ../../non-goals.rst:37
msgid ""
"Many people complain that there's no commonly agreed on standard format "
"for schematics and boards in the industry. The file formats for these are "
"application files formats, meaning that they'll need to support each and "
"every knob and button the application has. Adopting another application's "
"file format for horzion EDA would therefore result in horizon EDA being a "
"bad clone of the other application."

"JSON has been chosen as a serialization format as it directly maps to "
"common data structures such as maps and arrays (opposed to XML) and is "
"easily manipulated in almost every environment."
