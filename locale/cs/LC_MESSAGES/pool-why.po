"So what's all this Pool stuff anyhow? Many EDA packages organize "
"packages, symbols and the like in libraries. These are often messy and "
"version-controlling these is difficult since many independent parts are "
"put in a single file. Especially the latter often makes collaboration "
"difficult."

"With horizon, there are no libraries. Instead all the non-project "
"elements (symbols, etc.) are stored in a pool. Similar to the \"central "
"library\" approach common among the more enterprisey EDA packages."

"However the new thing here is, that a Part within this pool is *composed* "
"of multiple other elements, that handle different aspects of the Parts "
"nature:"

"For example you can define one \"Quad NAND\" Entity and reuse it for each "
"new NAND Part, without having to redefine the Gates time and time again. "
"The Quad NAND Entity in turn is composed of multiple Single Opamp NAND "
"Units and one Power Unit. If you now want to make a Dual NAND Entity, you "
"can just reuse the already existing Units and this guarantees you "
"consistency with the other NAND parts in your pool."

"Each of these elements that make up a Part is stored in a single json "
"file in the respective directory, i.e. /symbols, /entities, /units, /"
"parts, etc. The exact location within these directories is irrelevant, as "
"long the json file is stored in the correct directory: Symbols in /"
"symbols, Units in /units and so on. Additionally it is important for the "
"files to end in \".json\" so they can be picked up by the pool updater. "
"To make searching for parts more convenient, the metadata of all json "
"files is aggregated into a sqlite database. This is what the 'Update "
"pool' button in the Pool Manager is for."

msgid ""
"Naturally a pool with a focus on composition is organized using tags "
"instead of a hierarchical system since these often lead to (unnecessary) "
"confusion over aspects like whether to group parts by manufacturer or "
"other attributes."

"Although you can create your own pool, you are strongly encouraged to use "
"the pool over at `https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/ <https://"
"github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/>`__. To add new parts to it, simply "
"submit a merge request. See also: :doc:`Contribute to the Pool <pool-"
