"Horizon's Editors rely on fast and intuitive single key shortcuts and key "
"sequences alike. While this is very powerful for those who use it daily, "
"it could be cumbersome for those who just started out or have long "
"periods passing between each of their electronics projects."

"In order to make the transition between beginner and power user an easy "
"one, Horizon EDA has a Spacebar Menu, that (hence the name) pops up after "
"you pressed :kbd:`Spacebar`. In this menu all Tools you can select within "
"the Editor's Canvas are listed. To help you getting faster the shortcuts "
"and key sequences are listed alongside the tools. So if you find yourself "
"in the position of having to go to the space bar menu over and over "
"again, you can easily speed up things, by using the short cuts."
