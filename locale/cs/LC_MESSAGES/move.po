"You can move parts and nets by selecting them and typing :kbd:`m`, press :"
"kbd:`Alt` to move on a fine grid. The movment of the selected object has "
"its origin (or pivot) point right at the spot where the interactive "
"manipulator was, when you started the move tool."

"This can be used to our advantage, because it allows us to move objects "
"that have been placed on a finer grid without snapping them back to the "
"coarse grid."

"By using the :kbd:`←/↑/↓/→` arrow keys you can move the selected object "
"one grid step into the desired direction. If you press :kbd:`Alt` at the "
"same time you will move the part on the fine grid (1/10 of the original "
"grid). Because this is also a tool, you can cancel it by pressing :kbd:"
"`Esc` and finish it by pressing :kbd:`Enter` or clicking onto a empty "
"spot."

"You can flip symbols or parts by pressing :kbd:`e`. If you use this on "

msgid ""
"You can rotate objects by 90° if you press :kbd:`r` or select the \"rotate"
"\" tool. If you like to rotate a object by something else (e.g. 30° or "
"45°) use the \"Rotate arbitrary\" tool. The pivot point of the rotation "
"is always the location of the interactive manipulator, so make sure it is "
"at the right spot"
