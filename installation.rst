So you wanna give horizon a test drive? Great! Here's how.

Stable release
--------------

A known-good snapshot from ongoing development.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Download and run the MSI installer from `GitHub releases <https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases>`_.

Linux
^^^^^

Get the latest stable release from `Flathub <https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.horizon_eda.HorizonEDA>`_.

If you want to compile it yourself, download the source tarball from
`GitHub releases <https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases>`_ and follow the instructions in :doc:`build-linux`.

For Arch Linux, there's an `AUR package <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/horizon-eda>`_.

Keep in mind that binary packages provided by your distribution might be out of date.


Development version
-------------------

Usually works, but might break occasionally, so use at your own risk.
Recommended if you want to get the latest in features and bug fixes.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Grab the latest build from `AppVeyor CI <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carrotIndustries/horizon/build/artifacts>`_ 
and unzip it somewhere. Note that these are 64bit binaries. In case a
build is still running or someone broke the build, you can download past
builds from
`the build history <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carrotIndustries/horizon/history>`_
(click on artifacts to get the zip)

Linux
^^^^^

Clone the repository and see :doc:`build-linux` for
