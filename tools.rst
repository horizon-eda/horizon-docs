In order to provide a unified user experience and enable code reuse, the
editors for symbols, schematic, padstack, package and board are all
based on the interactive manipulator.

How to select the right tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit the things on screen, use the tools. Tools can be started in
multiple ways:

-  By typing in the tool's key sequence. Available key sequences are
   listed by clicking the help button in the top right corner or typing
   :kbd:`?`.
-  By using the :doc:`Spacebar Menu<spacebar-menu>`.
   Just start typing for the tool you're looking for or browse through
   the list.
-  By right clicking an object. This will bring up context menu listing
   all the tools relevant to what's selected.
-  By pressing one of the dedicated buttons in the top bar.

After having started a tool, it receives all keyboard and mouse input, till the tool is finished or you end it by pressing :kbd:`Esc`.
Look at the bar that appeared at the bottom of the canvas to see what
pressing keys will to in this particular tool.
